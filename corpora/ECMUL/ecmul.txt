548	so, i know that i spent anywhere from 200-300/month on drinking.   while i'd like to use that money overall to pay off debt and move up in life - this first month i'm going to treat myself a little to some things i would not have prioritized or cared much about drinking.  1 week is tomorrow.  given <e1>i don't drink today</e1> - <e2>i am going to treat myself to a hot springs soak</e2> and <e3>mud wrap in idaho springs</e3>.   that's a 30 dollar treat.   easily could drink that or more today.  but don't care too :) the other perks i'm interested in are a ski pass to aspen for 4 days and a new pair of boots.    while i'm kind of indulging in order to experience what makes me really happy in life, i'm also aware of holding back some so i'm not simply chasing a different dragon.   hope everyone has a happy, healthy, sober sunday!	cause-effect((e1,e2),(e1,e3))

1132	hey! i started on 30 mg vyvanse last saturday.  i noticed that the first few days i was incredibly focused and as the week wore on it's slowly tapered off.  i don't really feel quite as focused, i still get distracted - though it's less often than it normally is - and i'm starting to steadily feel fatigued again. i've been taking it with magnesium, wellbutrin, and zoloft.  i make sure to eat even if food doesn't look appealing.  i've been making sure i get 8 hours of sleep a night (even if it means just laying in the dark all night staring at the ceiling) and going from class to class throughout the day involves a looooot of walking.  in hill country.  with tons of stairs.  so i think i get a decent amount of exercise for someone who also has a chronic illness. nany ideas as to what's happening? i know i have to do the work, but it just seems less effective than it did earlier this week.  	noncause

1232	just reached my limit now.  i have dissociative identity disorder and i'm just not coping with the memories, the amnesia, the dangerous things that are happening.  i feel depressed as anything, and have trialed almost every antidepressant in existence.  i can't stand feeling this sad anymore.  i can't get over what happened.  there's no treatment where i am for what i've got, been told have to wait over a year, but in the meantime i'm not coping.  i'm so sick of all this now, think tonight i say goodbye to this fucked up world.  	noncause
1236	hey just saying i have attempted suicide at all but i have been having thoughts about it.  it is weird because <e1>i have a lot of self esteem and confidence</e1> so <e2>i know i should not be having these thoughts</e2>.  it is just that at times it feels like my mind is attacking itself.  i get into bouts where there is nothing i can think about but killing myself.  <e3>i know it gets better and that there is a end</e3> because <e4>there is always the times where it does end</e4>.  i just feel that each time i get into one of these bouts it gets just a bit worse and im worried for myself with upcoming stress.  i am just looking for some kind words here.	cause-effect((e1,e2),(e4,e3))
1240	so, i've been hearing voices for a few months ever since my first suicide attempt, but i've never had visual hallucinations.  but a few days ago, i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw a girl in my room, i couldn't see her very well but <e1>i was terrified</e1>. i later assumed it was just because <e2>i was half asleep</e2>, but the day after, i was in my room and i turned around and she was there.  i don't know what to do, she really scares me and i'm afraid of going back to my room.  even though i'm on medication it's getting harder to believe the voices and the girl aren't real, it's just so convincing.  <e3>i'm afraid of telling my mother it's getting worse</e3> because <e4>i don't want to be anymore of a burden to her</e4>.  what should i do?	cause-effect((e2,e1),(e4,e3))

1936	overall, i just don't like life.   at all.   i don't want to exist; or at least, i don't want to be aware of my existence.   i'm bored with life, and i don't want to do it anymore.   it's like having to play a video game you don't like, and there's no way to quit without causing severe emotional trauma to those around you. i feel trapped. 	noncause
1940	autistic pride is fucked up! they say people with low functioning autism are normal and are just different.  they are not different, many of the low functioning autistic are nonverbal and cant even spell their own name! they can?understand that they are even alive! autistic pride should have been for the high functioning autistics and not the lower ones.  oh and the founder of it agrees that low functioning autism is normal as well, what kind of fucking idiot is he!!??anyone else here agree?	noncause
1944	this morning i had an argument with my mom, it wasn't really a calm productive argument we both were yelling at one another.  <e1>i was having a mental breakdown</e1>  because <e2>she talks too much and very loud and i hate loud voices so much</e2> , it scares me.  so instead <e3>i was all shouting and yelling at her then i started crying</e3> ,  i didn't even feel myself yelling and being that angry.  my sister joined us up and said to me stop living in your fake ass dark sad shell and grow up, you think everyone is against you and that's not true it's just a reaction to whatever you have done.  i think i'm too sensitive and everything affect me in some way.  it just baffles me how these words got to me so much	cause-effect((e1,e3),(e2,e1))
1948	i just received the comments from my book reviewer for my thesis.  and there's so much comments as compared to my peers' work and i feel shitty. i wasn't really able to advise but i think i did a pretty good job with it but my ideas don't seem to come across, as per my book reviewer.  i know, even with myself, my ideas are all over the place, but i really tried my best.  i'm currently having an anxiety attack and am trying to calm myself down and look into what i can do about my thesis. 	noncause
1952	hey everyone - just wondering what type of impulsive behaviour you exhibit? i know the common perception is a fidgety kid running around, but for me, food impulsivity (eating for short term gratification) and sexual impulsivity are the ways that i act out.   my psychologist (during cognitive behavioural therapy), said that i'm acting out like this to get a hit of dopamine. . .  anyone else get the same?	noncause
1956	6 months ago i was suicidal and spent a little over a week in a psych facility.  i was worried about losing my job and the strain it was putting on my relationships with pretty much everyone around me.     since i have gotten out, i have gotten my meds right, (lamictal and triazolam to combat insomnia that came with it).  i have been exercising, eating right and making an effort to really build a social support network.  and now for 6 months i have been nearly entirely asymptomatic.  my relationship with friends, family, and my wife have never been better.  i am crushing it at work and can't remember i time i was happier about how my life was going.   i am not trying to brag, i just want to remind everyone that it can get better.  keep your chin up, you have made it this far, you can keep going.  	noncause
1960	i don't have a diagnosis of adhd, so i hope it's okay for me to post here.  i have anxiety / depression &amp; there's a particular symptom (that one ^^) that kept coming up with adhd when i googled it, so i thought it would be sensible to ask here. my problem is i often become overwhelmed by something i need to do and can't break it down into the necessary steps of doing it.  my brain just won't do it, it's like it fills up with question marks instead. i'm hoping people here will know how to combat this, or how to override it so i can think of how to tackle problems on my own. it can be embarrassing to admit that i just 'don't get' how i'm supposed to start something. **tl;dr** how do i break things down into steps, especially when i'm feeling overwhelmed? 	noncause
1964	<e1>i thought i had a friend but she does not want to be friends for whatever reason</e1>.  yes <e2>i think about suicide</e2> but i dont want to post in suicide watch because that is not my focus.  <e3>i am having a lot of trouble getting a job or even finding a good volaunteering or internship oppurtunity</e3>.  i am so tired right now but i cant sleep.  i wish i could get a hug from a friend.  i lack physical contact.  i think that is something people underestimate about human beings.  we need physical contact with others for our mental health.  there is a strong probability a rope or a bullet is a going to give me that physical contact at some point in the next few years if the last 15 won't end. i feel like banging my head against the wall and screaming.  i want intimacy in my life but i have no job and <e4>i am not good looking</e4> so <e5>online dating is hard</e5>.  i am very angry i do not look good in pictures. yes i had therapy today and have been taking my meds.	cause-effect((e1,e2),(e3,e2),(e4,e5))
1968	this happens from time to time when it's impossible to focus, i can feel my heart beating in my chest, and i'm super anxious (for what seems like no reason).  i know this must be fairly common with adhd.  what do you do and/or take to cope with this problem?	noncause
1972	so, i've been with my boyfriend for over a year now.  he really loves me and tries his best to be a good boyfriend.  but i feel like being in a serious relationship is a lot of pressure.  i'm always worried about making him upset and commitment kind of scares me lately.  i want to be with him now but i don't think i want to marry him or anything, so i start thinking about the future and feel guilty.  all this stuff makes me wonder if being single would be a relief.  but i have no reason to break up with him.  i don't like being responsible for someone else's happiness which is kind of how it feels.  i just want to believe that it's okay to be with someone i might not be with forever and that it's okay to have doubts, that all this stuff is okay but i don't know if it is?	noncause
1976	i'm on day 14 and i've felt less depressed the last few days and feel pretty good physically (for example,  went for a run today over a mile and pushed myself to not stop once, something i haven't been able to do for a very long time).  i also have fully stopped drinking alcohol now.  i feel pretty withdrawn though like i can't really muster interest in interactions with people.  i kind of just have this zoned out feeling, sort of like being high but without the feeling good part.  i guess i would say i feel like a potato or something but i can still think fine in terms of my job,  etc.  just wondering if anyone has also experienced this and if anything helped? 	noncause
1980	i'm a big king of the hill fan.  but, recently, while rewatching it, i've realized that it's a huge comfort beneath the comedy of a propane salesman and his life.  king of the hill has given me a lot of insight, especially when my ptsd gets bad. i rewatched the episode with the vietnam veterans and the wwii vets and for some reason, when they corner cotton, what he says hits different. . .  hank is disappointed that he didn't get cotton away from the band of angry, triggered vietnam vets and cotton tells him: you can do everything right and still lose.  it's not your fault.  you did your best. the whole episode is pretty good but that last line always makes me feel better.  i tried my best, and what happened happened.  it's not my fault.  it never was. 	noncause
1984	i hate everything about my life.  every single day i?scared.  headaches are brain aneurysms.  chest pains are heart attacks.  shortness of breath is covid.  any numbness is stroke.  if my arm hurts, i have an infection.  fever is sepsis.  it?a constant and it?caused me to develop depression.  i hate my life and want to just feel happy and not get anxiety every single time my body feels anything. 	noncause
1988	i watched wall-e tonight, and had tears in my eyes or cried pretty much throughout the entire movie.  it was expected, as it happened (embarrassingly) back when i watched it in a theatre.  but i can't really put my finger on what it is that makes me so sad about watching it.  maybe the loneliness, the longing, the insecurities of reaching out to someone who comes from a very different world. anyone else have this feeling about a movie?	noncause
1992	everybody loves talking about meds, so i thought i'd open a thread for sharing.  i'm on 50mg of pristiq and 50mg of lamictal (i feel like this dose is very low, but my doctor got me there and said to stay) in the morning. i take 40mg of latuda, unisom, and 5mg of melatonin at night.  i am on xanax . 25mg as needed/to sleep, but i haven't taken it since i started the latuda when i was diagnosed in december.  i didn't like the xanax, and my family has a very solid history of drug abuse.  i also take 10mg of singulair for asthma at night ;) i vape.  i was at 36mg nicotine for nerves, but since january have been cutting back.  it has helped me so much! i'm not freaking out over nicotine any more, so it was actually having a detrimental effect! i'm at 8mg starting this week.  i still use my vape like a pacifier sometimes, but it's less necessary.  i am not currently in therapy, but i'm the most stable i've been in 15 years. 	noncause
1996	i think about killing myself all the time, and i probably would if the consequences (such as hurting my family) weren't so severe.  but the thing is, even though i'm overwhelmed, life is going in the direction i want it to.  i feel okay about my future and how things are going for me right now.  i struggle with panic attacks but it's usually manageable.  the chances of me actually killing myself are low but will i ever stop wanting to? 	noncause
2000	as a child i remember feeling like life was a dream  i would wake up one day as a baby again live actual life.  (does this make sense? i may not have worded it right. . . for example i am 21 today but i would wake up tomorrow as my first day of life as if my real life was really a dream im having as a baby) of course i grew out of that belief as i got older but i still feel like life is a movie  i feel stuck  distant.  as a teenager i once made my own theory that everyone was playing a role in my life with scripts  everything  somehow im the main character  everything that happens in the world somehow connects back to me (basically only i exist  i made the movie subconsciously) pretty much a recurring theme in my life is not feeling real :( im starting to lose my short term memory im afraid i may be experiencing psychosis . . . sorry for the rant	noncause
2004	i suffer with severe anxiety and depression, its been a 3 year spiral downward, 40 years old, on xanax for a year then went cold turkey which was pretty bad, since then i've been drinking heavily, ive not been abusive or aggressive towards my family, i have two kids 5 and 10, not drunk for two days so withdrawals are not helping, had about two hours sleep last night, the thought of leaving my home and my family is unbearable, but i can't blame her, she said she never knows what shes coming home to, i love them all dearly, i cant see any future without them, not really sure why im posting this, i dont have anyone else to talk to. 	noncause

2128	<e1>have a new doctor</e1>  due to <e2>switchover from private insurance to medicaid</e2> .  took a while to find a doctor in my hmo who would prescribe adderall, so i have been parceling out my last rx like a castaway on a deserted island.  on top of adhd, i have a chronic, disabling multisystemic illness (probably nervous system damage of some sort).  i'm specifically <e3>taking adderall</e3>  because <e4>it has a side-effect of easing my other symptoms</e4> .  was very discombobulated on the day of the visit to my new dr - i forgot to bring paperwork from my old dr showing i have adhd.  surprisingly, the new dr still agreed to continue my adderall rx (xr + ir).  he just asked that i fax the paperwork over asap. then, things got weird: i didn't receive a paper rx.  my local pharmacy called to notify me that my rx was ready before i even got home from the doctor's office.  i only got 1/3 of the xr pills. . . they told me they would owe me the other 2/3.  the entire pharmacy staff seemed to drop everything to observe me as i picked it up.  a few days have passed now. 	cause-effect((e2,e1),(e4,e3))

2136	every single day.  every single minute.  i constantly feel worried, and have that deep, dreading feeling that something awful will happen.  i haven't slept in days.  i'm scared of everything.  i am told that i have nothing to fear, that it doesn't matter, but it matters to me.  i'm worried that somebody walking near our door is going to knock.  i worry that somebody will break in.  i worry that i'm going to be killed.  i worry that i'll get a text saying that i have to find somewhere else to live.  i'm worried that i'll be alone.  my mind never stops racing, my heart won't stop pounding, and i always feel sick to my stomach.  i don't know what to do anymore.  i just want it all to end. 	noncause
2140	hi everyone.  i was diagnosed with adhd last spring, and i got testing done recently; it said that i'm most definitely predominately-inattentive.  i take vyvanse daily for school.  recently i've been feeling really <e1>anxious</e1> while on the <e2>medication</e2>, but when i'm not on it, sometimes i just get really anxious when there's no reason to be.  however, when trying to <e3>do a lot of hw</e3> i <e4>sort of shrink into a ball mentally</e4> and get really <e5>worried</e5>.  how do you distinguish between anxiety caused by adhd and symptoms of an anxiety disorder? also, what are some non-medication methods to deal with anxiety? thanks. 	cause-effect((e1,e2),(e3,e4),(e3,e5))
2144	i've suffered from massive depression ever since i was a little child.  i never remember ever actually being happy.  i used to hurt myself when i was younger, hoping that something would happened to me.  that i wouldn't be able to recover somehow.  as i grew up, i started to fight the thoughts of self-harm.  the thoughts that told me i should just quit and end it.  i was always a lonely person.  i even managed to get myself something or a girlfriend by age 26! and then, she screwed me over.  absolutely tore out my heart and gleefully laughed at it it seems.  it's the worst feeling i've ever had.  it's been a while and when i think i'm getting better, i break down again.  i broke down at work and cried in front of customers, which is never actually fun.  the thoughts are back and stronger than ever.  i hurt myself physically for the first time in years the other day.  i'm afraid it's only going to get worse.  i keep wondering why i'm trying.  i'm afraid the thoughts are winning, and i won't be able to fight them this time.  	noncause
2148	i wake up with the anxiety that today could be my last, i go out with the anxiety that someone there could end it here, i do things with the anxiety that if i?not cautious enough, a simple thing could strip my life short.  can someone tell me how to remedy this?	noncause
2152	ok so i have anxiety and depression and sometimes i deal with derealization.  but tonight i felt that x100.  i was on the phone with my boyfriend and i started experiencing derealization but something thats never happened started happening, i started rambling super fast just nonsense, it felt like i couldnt even control what was coming out of my mouth.  it was like the words were just flowing out naturally but i didnt even know what i was saying.  i cant even remember that much of it.  but while i was just going on rambling i felt this weird euphoric feeling.  like i was high.  and it felt good? i hung up and felt like i had 0 thoughts.  its like it took me a while for my brain to start working/thinking.  and then i just broke down and started crying.  and then after i cried i just started to freak out about what had just happened.  does anyone know what this couldve been? is it just anxiety?	noncause

2164	here's the link  theguardian. com/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/adhd-dangerous-street-meth-americans-are-getting-hooked i've been seeing this sort of attitude about adhd medication coming up again and again and again and i'm so frustrated.  but part of me is also scared that maybe it's right? what do you think? a lot of this article made me very mad but i'm also not sure how to articulate those feelings.  thoughts?	noncause
2168	i know it's not a huge accomplishment, but i feel like if i post about it here i will be less tempted to start again.  i've been vaping 0mg which is fun and tastes really nice, but i'm having crazy cravings.  i wasn't a heavy smoker or anything, a pack of 25 would usually last me 5 days at least so i'm confused as to why the cravings are so bad. whatever, 10 days wooo	noncause
2172	straight female here.  i feel as though any time my boyfriend talks about a celebrity he finds really attractive or an ex or someone he used to be in love with, i get incredibly hurt and start to spiral.  even if it was said kingly?  sometimes to the point where i break down crying.  it just makes me feel gross and like a second choice.  i don?know how to handle my emotions during these moments and i feel so embarrassed afterwards. 	noncause
2176	i was studying engineering and had 2 years left.  everyone i know held me in high esteem.  for various reasons, i've done poorly this past year and am about to get kicked out of university.  all the work, sacrifice and stress that i've put to reach this point has suddenly gone out the window and i don't know what's gonna happen.  although i do have abilities in other things, there's *nothing* else i'd rather be than an engineer.  it's that or nothing. at this point, i'm just mentally and physically exhausted.  i don't even have any emotion in me right now, but am extremely disappointed for having failed and feel really dumb for wasting time/money (and then venting about it over here) :/	noncause
2180	im a 15 year old boy that has been depressed for about 3 months now and <e1>im just sick of it</e1>, im exhausted 24/7 and <e2>all i want to do is either sleep or lay in bed all day and stare at the wall with my thoughts</e2>.  <e3>havent been to school since january</e3> because i do online school and im just hoping that when i return to school in august, it will all get better.  <e4>i feel completely lonely</e4> and havent told anybody that i feel trapped in constant sadness.  i guess what im asking is, am i able to get better without having to tell my parent or my brother that im depressed and getting depression meds? <e5>im worried</e5> that <e6>im always going to feel this way</e6>. 	cause-effect((e2,e1),(e3,e4),(e6,e5))
2184	i'm just over a month into this quit.  since the first week ended, i've had a pretty easy time avoiding smoking, and i have had a lot of days already where i don't even think about smoking at all. but last night i was at work late, trying to finish a project before monday morning, and i was tired, and i was cranky that i was working and not at home, and for some reason i was trying to convince myself that i could just go buy a pack and chain smoke while i was working and then throw the pack away before i went to sleep.  this wasn't one of those 5-minute cravings that goes away, i literally had about a 2-hour mental conversation with myself before i finally decided it wasn't worth it. i was successful this time, but it was kind of scary because i know there was a pretty good chance it could have went the other way.  i'm kind of worried that this will happen again in a few weeks and i won't be so lucky. 	noncause
2188	told my doctor i wanted to switch back to ritalin from aderall.  since <e1>i was experienceing heighten anxiety</e1>, <e2>my mind was too stimulated to sit and focus on one task</e2>.  but, there seemed to be a language barrier and he immeditely switch me to vyvanse (20mg) and pointed to the door. . my god. . .  <e3>i was expecting dissapointment</e3> since <e4>i thought vyvanse was just an extended release version of aderall xr</e4>.  however, i experience the exact opposite effect of aderall.  <e5>less stimulation for my mind</e5>, so <e6>i'm able to focus and stay calm</e6>. this might be a useless thread, but i'm just shocked that vyvanse seemed to more successful yet it's practically the same thing as aderall.  thoughts?	cause-effect((e1,e2),(e4,e3),(e5,e6))

2196	that girl was having really open interest in me.  not only that, but i like her too.  and yet tonight instead of kissing her (again; it would've made the whole thing a thing), i told her to find someone mentally stable that's sure to live untill the end of the month and that it wouldn't be fair if i do anything. did i make the right decision regarding me? hell no! did i make the right desicion regarding her? i hope so. fuck my life. 	noncause
2200	i have a wonderful life.  my family loves me, i have bunch of great friends, a gf of 7 years, enough money, acomplishments in my hobbies.  yet i still wanna die. i have stopped living for myself long ago.  <e1>i am living</e1> cause <e2>killing myself would cause pain to people i care about</e2>.  so i survived.  i learnt to not be suicidal all the time.  i learnt to not actively hate myself (most days now i think i'm an ok human being).  i started taking antidepressants.  yet <e3>i still wanna die</e3>. <e4>i am just tired</e4>.  existing alone is so hard it is not worth it for me.  i don't wanna be here and at this point i think there is no chance of this changing.  i will live unhappy for another 50 years. thank you for reading this. 	cause-effect((e2,e1),(e4,e1))
