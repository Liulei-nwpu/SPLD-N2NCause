my family is struggling the pandemic	the governments lack of action upon it	due to
i cant talk about it with anyone	no one would understand	because
i have no reason to be depressed	i have a decently well off family (i'm 15) and i was quite good at school	because
i'm feeling so down right now	i just broke up	cause
i feel like after september im just gonna get 10 times worse	all my mates will be at uni, back to school and ill be here, alone and alone and alone	cause
i deserve to be in pain i guess	it's the only things that brings me comfort now and ever	because
i dont want to tell the people around me	i dont want to inconvenience them	because
had to move into my moms house to help her take care of bills	she has medical issues and was close to losing the house	because
i cannot afford to fuck my grades	i won't get a good college and the one i will get is gonna cost my parents a fortune	because
i feel sad	it could've been avoided	because
it hurts	i've been going through horrible anxiety attacks and episodes of depression	because
has anyone experienced being actually jealous of the ones that have passed	it wasnt you and you would do anything in your power to trade place because you think theyd do your life so much better?	because
i hate it, everytime im with someone i almost barley talk about myself and always make conversation about them or something else	theres nothing interesting about me and im not good at telling stories	because
i dont make that many friends	im not outgoing and that fun	because
i think of not being able to commit suicide	deep inside i still want to live	because
i feel horrible for missing a lot of deadlines and meetings	i just can't get over what's going on. and i'm so confused and tired	because
a bleeding stomach ulcer	the stress	caused by
convulsions	hormone deficiencies and imbalances	caused by
The warmth	the fireplace	was radiating from
a riot	the silversmiths	instigated by 
Sudden death	inhalation	from
The inflammation	unusual bacteria	caused by
death and morbidity		secondary infection		from
feel grief and sorrow		the loss		from
the heat		a boiler		come from
